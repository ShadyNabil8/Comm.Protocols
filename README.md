# Communication Protocols

Examples for UART, SPI and I2C protocols. In this demo I will use STM32 blue pill board and Arduino Uno board. STM32 CubeIde will be used for STM32 programming and PlatformIO will be used for Arduino programming.


## UART and SPI examples

In this example I used the STM to send data to the Arduino board to control the light of a led. I send 'N' to turn the led on and 'F' to turn the led off.
